# one-piece-color-spread-grabber
Grabs the latest color spreads from the One Piece wiki and saves them to a folder on your desktop. Useful for slideshow desktop backgrounds. Currently only works on Windows because of how I got the file path, but you can change the file path on your own if you want. Just edit the desktop variable.
